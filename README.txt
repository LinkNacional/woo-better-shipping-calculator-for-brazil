== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I CHANGE the text "Calculate shipping"? =

Use the following code:

add_filter(
	'wc_better_shipping_calculator_for_brazil_postcode_label',
	function () {
		return 'your new text';
	}
);

= How can I REMOVE the text "Calculate shipping"? =

Use the following code:

add_filter(
	'wc_better_shipping_calculator_for_brazil_postcode_label',
	'__return_null'
);

= Why is the Phone field now mandatory and asking for a Country Code (DDI)? =

This feature was added to ensure all essential customer contact data is complete and correctly formatted. The DDI (Dialing Code International) ensures the phone number is standardized for both national and international calls, which is crucial for logistics and customer service. You can disable this feature in the plugin settings under the Checkout tab.

= How does the automatic address lookup by CEP work? =

When the customer enters a valid 8-digit CEP (Brazilian postcode) on the checkout page, the plugin uses public APIs (like VIACEP and Brasil API) to automatically retrieve and fill in the Street, City, State, and Neighborhood fields, speeding up the checkout process.
